# Data Structures for C programmers
The purpose of this project is to create **efficient** and **easy to use** data structures for all of those developers who loves C language but they wonder to have **powerful tools to write their code like in Java** or mostly all modern Object Oriented language.

### We :heart: Data Structures
All most used data structures, **all implemented**. This is the dream and this project wants to make it real.

### Sorting, searching.. all power to your code
Another purpose of this project is to deliver all previous data structures with a lot of useful and *powerful methods*, including **sorting and searching**. Of course, all with the efficiency that only C language can achieves.

### Thread-safety? Yep :beer:
*Multiprogramming* is a must for high-performance applications, and also a great way to explore **new style for programming**. This library want to be designed to be **completely thread-safe!**

### C11 support
The last standard of C is really powerful, and some feature can improve a lot the usability of a library. This project wants to take all possible advantages from this, included **type-generic expression** and **multi-threading support** (yes, it is portable! *No POSIX needed*).
